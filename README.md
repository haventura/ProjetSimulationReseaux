# POO - Simulateur de réseaux électrique

This platform simulate the behaviour of an electrical grid at a country scale. The aim is to simulate the dynamic behaviour of a set of electrical power production centers and power consummers.
Thanks to this platform, researchers can develop automatic regulation schemes of the network in order to simulate disasters, optimise buy/sell markets with neighboring countries, study investement oportunity and reduce the environmental impact of the grid.

The platform offer a series of classes allowing researchers to build their own network, along with a broad implementation of most of these classes for presentation purpose. It is possible to create your own plants/consumers/fuels/... classes fitting your need by inheriting from the corresponding abstract superclass. The following documentation describe the most important part of the platform.
